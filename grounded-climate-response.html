          Highlighting the importance of moving from fear-driven to hope-driven
          responses, the discussions during the session emphasised resilience
          and community-driven action. Participants identified the disconnect
          between problem areas and where people live as a barrier to urgent
          action, as it creates a lack of immediacy in addressing climate change
          issues.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          The session advocated for nurturing all priority needs, recognizing
          intersectionalities, and inspiring stakeholders to translate intention
          into action. The N.O.U.R.I.S.H framework was introduced as a guide to
          harness hope and agency.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          N: Nurture all the priority needs together <br />
          O: Onboard all the other themes by highlighting intersectionalities

          Realise short term and long term goals <br />I: Inspire influencers
          and insiders among all stakeholders to move from intention to actionbr
          <br />
          S: Spark seeing, being, and doing together <br />
          H: Harness hope and agency

          Youth leaders shared experiences of impactful community engagement
          through art and environmental education, demonstrating the power of
          grassroots initiatives.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Key challenges discussed included the limited reach of climate
          resilience efforts to vulnerable populations, high climate-related
          displacements, and the difficulty of utilising common spaces in
          densely populated areas. Designing effective local policies and
          engaging various stakeholders were also noted, highlighting the
          complexity of systems change.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          The session underscored the necessity of practical tools and systems
          that enable individuals to make everyday changes and the role of
          economic drivers in motivating climate-friendly behaviours.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Key takeaways included the need for an integrated approach aligning
          goals across sectors, understanding community needs, and fostering
          decentralized planning. The session concluded with a call to action
          for individuals to embrace minimalistic options and initiate change
          within themselves, thereby contributing to broader climate priorities.

          Exploring the pivotal role young people play in transforming food
          systems, this session emphasised the importance of youth leadership in
          challenging perceptions that farming is not appealing, addressing
          urbanisation desires, and countering the risks associated with
          agriculture.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Women often encounter institutional barriers when trying to access
          capital and enter larger markets, which makes scaling their businesses
          difficult. Moving beyond the village level requires substantial
          funding, but that capital is often inaccessible due to risk
          perceptions in the formal financial system. Women entrepreneurs also
          struggle to break into mainstream markets, which remain opaque and
          hard to navigate without adequate support and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Currently, 1200 youth leaders are actively engaged in agroecology,
          focusing on understanding diverse food systems and the challenges
          faced by farmers. A significant barrier identified was the lack of
          awareness at the grassroots level and the difficulty in marketing
          organic products. This highlights the need for government support in
          financial aid and infrastructure development, alongside necessary
          policy changes to complement education efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Youth leaders like Trishna and Dimpy exemplify the transformative
          power of young people. Trishna promotes organic farming and
          alternative livelihoods, while Dimpy has successfully mobilised over
          100 farmers and initiated school nutrition gardens. These efforts
          illustrate the innovative potential of youth involvement, reminiscent
          of past technological revolutions driven by young minds.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Key takeaways stress the need to position young people at the centre
          of agro-ecological initiatives, dismantle the stigma around farming,
          and implement systemic policy changes. The session concluded with the
          introduction of “We, The Changemakers,” a guide aimed at empowering
          youth with the principles of agroecology to enhance resilience,
          resource efficiency, and social equity in food systems. This approach
          not only addresses current challenges but also lays the groundwork for
          a sustainable future.

          Centred on the ASRA’s Systemic Risk Assessment/Systemic Risk Response
          tool, this session aimed to gather feedback on its applicability from
          Indian practitioners. 
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
            Participants appreciated the principles and the
            tool for their potential to foster a comprehensive understanding of
            systemic risk by encouraging users to consider multiple,
            interconnected risks simultaneously. This holistic approach was
            recognized for its ambition to build a field around systemic risk
            response, which could enhance the depth and effectiveness of
            interventions. The tool’s framework was seen as a valuable starting
            point for fostering collaboration and dialogue among diverse
            stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
            Participants also provided constructive criticism,
            noting that the criteria are overly complex and filled with jargon,
            making it difficult for users to engage effectively. Simplification,
            including the use of images or sketches, was suggested to enhance
            usability and scalability. 
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
            The principles underpinning the tool were
            regarded as universal but lacked practical direction, failing to
            resonate with on-ground realities. Participants highlighted the need
            for a more targeted approach, allowing users to prioritise and justify
            their focus areas without being overwhelmed by exhaustive criteria.
            
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
            During the Q&A, concerns were raised about the tool’s purpose—whether
            it serves for evaluation or risk identification. It was clarified that
            the tool is intended to consider multiple risks simultaneously,
            advocating for a systemic response rather than addressing isolated
            risks. 
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
            Key actions identified included the need for user guidance to
            make the tool more accessible and relevant. Further collaboration
            between Swasti, ASRA, and experts like Professor Partha was proposed
            to refine the principles and criteria, ensuring they are both
            practical and adaptable to diverse contexts.

          The examination of blended finance focused on how it can bridge the
          gap between social impact and financial returns, especially within
          India’s development sector. The primary goals were to present global
          trends in blended finance, highlight case studies of social
          enterprises utilising philanthropic capital, and encourage discussions
          on integrating blended finance into participants’ initiatives. These
          goals were achieved through diverse case studies and expert insights.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          One of the standout case studies was shared by Nirav Khambhati from
          The Blended Finance Company, which is building a $50 million facility
          to mobilise commercial working capital for MSMEs in the WASH sector.
          He explained the challenges these enterprises face when raising debt
          capital, mainly due to insufficient collateral or lack of lender
          experience in underwriting for this segment. The discussion further
          explored the broader ethical questions around the commercialisation of
          basic needs like health and education.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Another critical point discussed was the importance of blended finance
          in facilitating social impact. Speakers noted that SSE can democratise
          funding by using financial instruments such as social venture funds
          and impact bonds, providing both financial returns and measurable
          social impact. By leveraging these instruments, the SSE can unlock new
          funding streams and encourage more investors to participate in the
          social sector. Mr. Mangesh emphasised the importance of bringing
          process orientation and discipline to NPOs, which can instil
          confidence in investors and enhance the credibility of listed
          organisations.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          Another interesting example came from Game Changers Law, which
          presented the use of convertible notes to facilitate soft debt for Me
          Meraki, a for-profit enterprise working with artisans. This example
          showed how private, non-philanthropic funds could be structured to
          benefit both social enterprises and investors.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          The case study by Waterfield focused on a pooled UHNI fund that
          provided capital access to women’s joint liability groups, packaging
          the investment in a way that emphasised both returns and social
          impact, appealing to commercial investors without losing the focus on
          wealth generation for underserved communities.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          A key takeaway was that structuring a blended finance program requires
          a strong Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) framework from day
          one to build trust among philanthropists and investors.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          In short, blended finance, as demonstrated through these case studies,
          holds transformative potential by making social ventures more
          “bankable,” helping to align philanthropic goals with commercial
          returns, and driving capital towards achieving Sustainable Development
          Goals (SDGs). The panellists emphasised that future efforts should
          focus on bringing donors, investors, and social enterprises together
          through well-structured, impact-driven financial instruments.

          This session delved into the multifaceted challenges hindering the
          progress of FPCs in the agricultural domain. Participants engaged in
          insightful conversations focusing on issues such as supply chain
          inefficiencies, limited bargaining power, and the critical lack of
          access to formal credit, all of which impede the growth potential of
          FPCs. The discussions emphasised the urgent need for innovative
          solutions that place a strong emphasis on bolstering infrastructure,
          streamlining financial systems, and implementing proactive market
          access reforms tailored specifically to suit the dynamic needs of
          FPCs.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          These deliberations underscored the importance of empowering FPCs to
          navigate the complex agricultural landscape with greater efficiency
          and resilience.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-4">
          The collaborative efforts within the groups underscored a collective
          commitment to enhancing governance structures, ensuring financial
          inclusivity, and fostering sustainable practices within the FPC
          ecosystem. By advocating for the establishment of a market-oriented
          federated structure and exploring unconventional strategies such as
          joint ventures with key buyers, participants aimed to drive FPCs
          towards greater scalability, market penetration, and sustainability.

        <p class="pt-4">
          The overarching narrative from the session highlighted the imperative

          access to vital resources like working capital, market intelligence,
          and strategic partnerships tailored to the unique requirements of
          FPCs. This collective approach aimed to catalyse transformative
          change, enabling FPCs to overcome existing barriers and thrive as key
